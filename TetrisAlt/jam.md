### Comment
I was planing on doing something in the margins of [Tricky Towers](https://www.trickytowers.com/).  
Im using the [pymunk](https://github.com/viblo/pymunk) physics engine. Everything worked great, \
but I wanted to freeze the tiles once the next spawns as you might think, that didn't worked out...  
soooo I got unmotivated and didn't even add anything like a score system or whatever :/
