# Sprouts

### Mission
Create the game sprouts.

### How to play
Mouse only \
the rest basically plays by it self and if you need help look at the right side of the screen, there you can see what you should do next  \
or else watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKsTGdN-4_M) or go to the [sprouts wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprouts_(game))

### Comment
This time I tried something i never do: Tackle everything bit by bit! \
You can see the progression in the progress folder ordered by numbers. \
Also good luck in case you want to look at the code... its a big mess...
