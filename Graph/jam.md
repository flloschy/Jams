# Graph

### Mission
A simple graphing tool where you give one or more functions which get plotted on the graph

### How to use
On the right side is a text field. \
Every new line is a new functions. \
Is used as Javascript. \
--> So something like. `Math.floor(x)*Math.sin(x)` is possible! \
--> but `2x` is not.

### Comment
Im very happy with how v2 ended in contrast to v1. \
Given that this is my first actual thing with canvas, copilot did all the heavy lifting. \
And I love it! \
Had fun, good end result, 10/10 :D
