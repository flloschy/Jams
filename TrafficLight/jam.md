### Mission
Simulate an intersection with 2 or more intersecting streets (like a T or Cross junction) with inbound car traffic. Goal is to optimize the timing of said lights to reduce overall build up, increase traffic flow and bring down the time any car needs to stand still. Bonus points when adding special traffic like transit or emergency services which are prioritized by the system. The user can only change the amount of traffic. (you dont need visuals, a function emulating traffic/timings is cool too)
